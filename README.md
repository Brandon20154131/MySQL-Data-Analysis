# MySQL-Data-Analysis
Data cleaning and exploratory analysis of global corporate layoffs using MySQL.
# Data Analytics Project



📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a real-world dataset of global layoffs using MySQL. It is divided into two key phases:

Data Cleaning — Preparing raw data for analysis by handling duplicates, standardizing fields, and formatting dates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Running SQL-based queries to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in the layoffs data.

🧹 Data Cleaning Process

The data_cleaning.sql script ensures high-quality, analysis-ready data.

Key Steps:

Create a staging table to preserve the raw dataset (best practice).

Remove duplicates using window functions with ROW_NUMBER().

Standardize text fields like company names, industries, and countries.

Convert and format date fields for time-series analysis.

Handle NULL and blank values consistently.

Remove irrelevant or incomplete rows and unnecessary columns.

Best Practices Applied:

Always perform cleaning in a staging environment to protect raw data.

Validate results after each transformation step.

Use clear, well-documented SQL logic for reproducibility.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory_analysis.sql script builds on the cleaned dataset (layoffs_staging2) to generate insights through SQL queries.

Analysis Highlights:

Aggregations — Total layoffs by company, country, industry, and year.

Rolling Totals — Cumulative layoffs tracked month over month.

Ranking Queries — Identify top companies and industries by layoff volume.

Outlier Detection (IQR Method) — Flag abnormal layoffs by industry.

Layoff Classification — Categorize events (e.g., “Full”, “Large”, “Medium”, “Small”).

Stored Procedure — Parameterized query to analyze layoffs by country and industry dynamically.

Example:
CALL CountryIndustryBreakdown('United States', 5);


➡️ Returns the top 5 industries with the most layoffs in the United States.

🧠 Insights Gained

Yearly and monthly trends in global layoffs.

Industries most affected by large-scale layoffs.

Top companies contributing to total layoffs over time.

Outlier detection helps identify unusual corporate downsizing events.

🧱 Tools & Technologies

Database: MySQL 8.0+

Language: SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, CASE statements)

Dataset: layoffs.json (transformed into relational format)

🧭 Best Practices Followed

Work from raw → staging → cleaned layers.

Document each transformation within scripts for transparency.

Apply consistent naming conventions and clear code comments.

Use parameterized procedures for flexible, reusable queries.
